# Frogger

### by: Toheeb Ashorobi

## Goal of the game

Itâ€™s simple

Mr. Froggy had a rough night and somehow ended up on the rough side of town.

He wants to get back home, but to do so he has to cross a dangerous highway.

The goal is to get Mr. Froggy safely across the highway and into the pond.

## Why Frogger?

Frogger is a grid based game.

This was a perfect chance for me to apply what I've learned in class. The project leaned heavily on JavaScript and I mainly used DOM manipulation to structure my HTML and functions.

I used the DOM to create a 12x12 grid and utilized many functions to call other functions.

Lastly I applied a bit of CSS to give my game a bit of a makeover.

I hope you guys enjoy my very first game!
